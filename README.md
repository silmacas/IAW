koel app
==============

The official desktop application for [Koel](https://github.com/phanan/koel), built on [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/).

The app will inherit all features from its web-based counterpart, plus functionalities only possible in a desktop environment, e.g. lower-level OS interactions like global media shortcuts. Basically, the best of both worlds.

## Installation

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/phanan/koel-app.git
cd koel-app
yarn
yarn dev # for development
yarn build # for a cool app
```

The project got its boilerplate from [electron-vue](https://github.com/SimulatedGREG/electron-vue) with some modifications, so head there for in-depth instructions.

## Notes

* Only tested on macOS High Siera so far, since that's the only OS I have.
